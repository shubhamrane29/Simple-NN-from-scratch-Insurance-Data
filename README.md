## Insurance Prediction Comparison: TensorFlow vs. Non-TensorFlow Models
This project focuses on predicting insurance purchases using two different approaches: TensorFlow-based neural network modeling and a non-TensorFlow methodology. The dataset contains three essential columns: 'age', 'affordability', and 'insurance bought'.

Approaches Implemented:
- Neural Network with TensorFlow: Constructing a neural network model utilizing 'age' and 'affordability' features for insurance purchase prediction.
- Model without TensorFlow: Developing an alternate model without TensorFlow, utilizing the same 'age' and 'affordability' features for predictive analysis.

The project showcases the similarities in prediction outcomes between the TensorFlow-based model and the non-TensorFlow model, offering insights into the effectiveness of both approaches in predicting insurance purchases based on age and affordability factors.
